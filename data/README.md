The data format for the social-LSTM model consists of four columns: 'frame_num', 'ped_id', 'y', and 'x'. Let's break down each column:
order is important :
```
['frame_num','ped_id','y','x']
```
1. 'frame_num': This column represents the frame number or timestamp of the data point. It indicates the specific time step at which the data was recorded. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a particular frame or time step.

2. 'ped_id': This column represents the unique identifier for each pedestrian or person in the scene. Each pedestrian is assigned a unique ID to distinguish them from others. This ID helps track the movement and interactions of individual pedestrians over time.

3. 'y': This column represents the y-coordinate or vertical position of the pedestrian in the scene. It indicates the position of the pedestrian along the vertical axis.

4. 'x': This column represents the x-coordinate or horizontal position of the pedestrian in the scene. It indicates the position of the pedestrian along the horizontal axis.

Together, these four columns provide information about the frame number, pedestrian ID, and the spatial coordinates (x and y) of each pedestrian in the scene. This data format is commonly used in social-LSTM models to capture the movement patterns and interactions among pedestrians in a given environment.

Here's an example to illustrate the data format:

```
frame_num | ped_id |    y    |    x
-----------------------------------
    1     |   1    |  10.5   |  20.2
    1     |   2    |  15.3   |  18.7
    2     |   1    |  11.2   |  21.1
    2     |   2    |  16.8   |  19.5
```

In this example, we have two pedestrians with IDs 1 and 2. For each frame (frame_num), we have their corresponding y and x coordinates. For instance, in frame 1, pedestrian 1 is located at (10.5, 20.2) and pedestrian 2 is located at (15.3, 18.7). Similarly, in frame 2, pedestrian 1 is located at (11.2, 21.1) and pedestrian 2 is located at (16.8, 19.5).

This data format allows the social-LSTM model to analyze the trajectories and interactions of pedestrians over time, enabling predictions and understanding of their behavior in a given environment.
